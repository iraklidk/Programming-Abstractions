# CS106B: Programming Abstractions

Welcome to my repository containing solutions for the CS106B: Programming Abstractions course offered by Stanford University. This course dives deep into essential programming concepts using C++, including recursion, data abstraction, and algorithmic problem-solving. Below, you'll find an overview of the assignments and their core concepts.

## Course Overview
CS106B is the second course in Stanford's introductory programming sequence. It builds upon the foundational skills taught in CS106A by focusing on the C++ language and introducing more complex programming topics such as:
- **Recursion:** Breaking down problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems.
- **Algorithm Analysis:** Understanding the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space.
- **Data Abstraction:** Encapsulating data within classes and structures for clean and modular code.
- **Advanced Data Structures:** Exploring the implementation and application of stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
## Assignments Overview
### Assignment 1-2: Warm-Up with C++
This introductory assignment familiarizes you with the syntax and features of C++. You'll implement basic programs to reinforce your understanding of variables, loops, and conditionals in the context of C++.
### Assignment 3: Recursion Practice
In this assignment, you explore the power of recursion through various classic problems like the Sierpinski Triangle, where a large problem is broken down into smaller identical problems. It reinforces the concept of base cases and recursive calls.
### Assignment 4: Recursive Backtracking
Here, you tackle more challenging problems that involve exploring all possible solutions, such as solving mazes or generating permutations. The assignment illustrates how recursive backtracking can be used to systematically explore and find solutions.
### Assignment 5: Linked Data Structures
You delve into linked lists, stacks, and queues. This assignment demonstrates the advantages of dynamic memory allocation and the flexibility of linked structures compared to arrays.
### Assignment 6: Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
In this assignment, you implement a BST, focusing on operations like insertion, deletion, and searching. The goal is to understand how trees provide efficient solutions for dynamically storing and retrieving data.
### Assignment 7: Graphs and Shortest Paths
This final assignment covers graph algorithms, such as Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. You’ll implement these algorithms and explore their applications in real-world scenarios.
